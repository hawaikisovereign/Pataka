## ✨ About

**Tatau AI** is the world’s first kaupapa Māori studio assistant — an AI-powered platform to empower independent artists (moko, tattoo, piercers, illustrators, painters) to manage their full creative practice:

✅ Studio management  
✅ Client care  
✅ Business & financial tools  
✅ Cultural integrity  
✅ Wellbeing  
✅ Legal & compliance

**Why the name “Tatau AI”?**

Metaphorically — “tatau” is the Polynesian word from which the global word “tattoo” is derived.  
As this platform blends traditional Māori values with global AI technology — “Tatau AI” honours both the depth of our cultural practices and the contemporary creative world we live in.
