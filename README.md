## ✨ About

**Pātaka** is the world’s first kaupapa Māori studio assistant — built as a modern digital *pātaka* (storehouse) of tools and agents, designed to empower independent artists (moko, tattoo, piercers, illustrators, painters) to manage their full creative practice:

✅ Studio management  
✅ Client care  
✅ Business & financial tools  
✅ Cultural integrity  
✅ Wellbeing  
✅ Legal & compliance

Pātaka helps artists thrive creatively, culturally, and financially — built entirely on tikanga Māori and aligned with Māori Data Sovereignty — with tools available for artists worldwide.

## 🛠️ Built Using:

- Kodex (iPad code editing)
- Working Copy (GitHub management)
- StackBlitz (frontend preview + testing)
- GitHub Actions (LLM-powered repo management)
- OpenAI API (for LLM agents — moving toward local Ollama in future)
- Agent reference material stored in `/src/data/` (text extracted from PDFs, cultural content)
- Public client-facing documents stored in `/public/docs/`
